Generate flowers and share them with people to show that you care.

## Requirements

`flower` depends on [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) and
[clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com/). To install them, I recommend using
[Bower](https://bower.io):

	bower install

or, equivalently,

	bower install paper
	bower install clipboard

## TODO

- Include customizable messages with flowers
- ~~Reduce URL length~~
- Allow for better customizability
